Primitive
=========
A simple library to deal with [Primitive Obsession](http://wiki.c2.com/?PrimitiveObsession) in C#.

## Build
Run

```
dotnet build
```

## Run tests
Run

```
dotnet test PrimitiveTest/PrimitiveTest.csproj
```

It should be possible to run tests with a simpler `dotnet test`, but I run in the issue ['dotnet test' in solution folder fails when non-test projects are in the solution #1129](http://wiki.c2.com/?PrimitiveObsession)
